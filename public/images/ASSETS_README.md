# Asset Drop Folder (Add Your Approved Images Here)

This folder is where we expect **your** approved photography to live.

## Required files

- `hero.jpg` (or `.png` / `.webp`)
  - Calm, natural-light home setting **or** caregiver + older adult interaction.
  - No “stock-smile”, no scrubs, no medical/tech vibe.
  - Recommended: ~2400px wide.

## Optional file

- `band.jpg` (or `.png` / `.webp`)
  - A restrained secondary image (quiet home environment or subtle Colorado exterior/landscape).
  - Recommended: ~2400px wide.

## Logo

Place the provided Colorado CareAssist logo as:
- `public/cca-logo.png`

The header will use it automatically. If it’s missing, the site falls back to a text logo.
