Many Colorado veterans and their families don’t realize this until it’s almost too late:

**The VA does help pay for non-medical home care.**

Unlike Medicare, the Department of Veterans Affairs recognizes that aging veterans often need help with daily living — not just medical treatment.

If you’re a veteran or surviving spouse in Colorado, this guide explains **how VA home care works, who qualifies, and how to get started**.

## Does the VA Pay for Home Care?

**Yes — in many cases, the VA pays for non-medical home care.**

VA-covered services may include:

* Assistance with bathing and grooming
* Dressing and toileting support
* Meal preparation
* Mobility and fall prevention
* Light housekeeping
* Companionship and supervision

These services are often referred to as **Homemaker/Home Health Aide (H/HHA) services**.

## How VA Home Care Is Different from Medicare

This is where many families get tripped up.

| Feature | Medicare | VA Home Care |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Focus** | Short-term medical recovery | Ongoing daily support |
| **Type of Care** | Skilled nursing / Therapy only | Non-medical personal care allowed |
| **Duration** | Ends when "stable" | Continues as needed |
| **Personal Care** | Not covered (unless with skilled care) | **Often covered** |

For aging veterans who need help staying in their own homes long-term, the VA model is far more realistic than Medicare.

## Common VA Home Care Programs in Colorado

### 1. VA Community Care
When VA facilities can’t provide care directly (or are too far away), veterans may receive authorization to use **community providers** closer to home. This is the most common pathway for home care in Colorado.

### 2. Homemaker / Home Health Aide (H/HHA)
This program focuses on **daily living assistance**, not medical treatment. Care is authorized by the VA based on clinical need and provided by approved community agencies like Colorado CareAssist.

### 3. Caregiver Support (Limited Scope)
Some veterans qualify for caregiver support programs that offer training or stipends to family caregivers. These programs are more restrictive but helpful in certain cases.

## Who Qualifies?

Eligibility is determined by several factors, including:

* Veteran status and discharge type
* Enrollment in VA health care
* Clinical need for assistance with daily activities
* Availability of services in your area

**You do NOT need to be 100% disabled** to qualify. Many veterans who served decades ago are eligible and simply never told.

## What VA Home Care Does NOT Require

VA home care:
* Does **not** require private long-term care insurance
* Is **not** income-based like Medicaid
* Does **not** end simply because care is non-medical

This makes it one of the most valuable — and underused — benefits available to veterans.

## How the Authorization Process Works

1. Veteran is assessed by VA or VA-connected provider
2. VA determines clinical need
3. Care is authorized through **VA Community Care**
4. Approved agency provides services
5. VA pays the agency directly

Families are often surprised at how manageable the process becomes once it’s initiated.

## Common Mistakes Veterans Make

* Assuming Medicare is enough (it isn't for long-term care)
* Waiting until a crisis to ask for help
* Not asking specifically about **home care**
* Giving up after the first “no”

## Local Matters

VA care is **regional**, and Colorado has its own authorization pathways and provider networks.

Working with an agency that understands VA Community Care, knows Colorado VA processes, and handles VA billing correctly makes a meaningful difference.

**Colorado CareAssist** is an approved community provider for VA-authorized home care services, serving Denver, Boulder, Colorado Springs, Pueblo, and the Front Range.

## Final Takeaway

Veterans earned more than gratitude — they earned support. VA home care can be the difference between staying at home or being forced into a facility.

If you’re a veteran or caring for one, it’s worth asking the question — even if no one has mentioned it before.
