In Colorado, attorneys, court-appointed guardians and conservators, and agents acting under Power of Attorney are routinely responsible for approving or recommending home care services for vulnerable adults. These decisions carry legal, fiduciary, and personal liability — not just moral responsibility.

Selecting a home care provider is not a casual referral. It is a risk-management decision that must withstand scrutiny from courts, family members, regulators, and — in some cases — opposing counsel.

This guide outlines what fiduciaries in Colorado should require before engaging a home care agency.

## 1. Verify Proper Colorado Licensing (Non-Negotiable)

All home care agencies operating in Colorado must be licensed by the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment (CDPHE) and comply with 6 CCR 1011-1, Chapter 26.

As a fiduciary, you should confirm:
*   **Active CDPHE license** (not provisional or expired)
*   **Correct license classification:**
    *   **Class A** – Skilled home health and non-medical care
    *   **Class B** – Non-medical personal care only
*   Services provided match the client’s current and foreseeable needs

Authorizing care outside an agency’s license scope exposes guardians, conservators, and POAs to unnecessary liability.

## 2. Demand Written Disclosures, Contracts & Fee Schedules

Colorado law requires written disclosures — but fiduciaries should go further. Before approving care, insist on written documentation covering:

*   Scope of services and limitations
*   Fee schedule (hourly rates, minimums, overtime, holidays)
*   Billing cadence and payment terms
*   Emergency procedures and escalation protocols
*   Termination and cancellation policies

If something is not in writing, it cannot protect the client — or you — later.

## 3. Care Planning, Supervision & Documentation

From a legal standpoint, documentation is evidence. A competent home care provider should deliver:

*   Initial functional and safety assessment
*   Written, individualized care plan
*   Ongoing supervision and reassessments
*   Documented care plan updates as needs change

For guardians and conservators, this creates a defensible record demonstrating decisions were reasonable, informed, and aligned with the ward’s best interests.

## 4. Caregiver Screening, Training & Oversight

You are authorizing third parties into a protected individual’s home. That risk must be mitigated. Verify the agency maintains:

*   Criminal background checks
*   Identity verification and employment eligibility
*   Role-specific training (dementia care, transfers, fall prevention)
*   Clear procedures for caregiver removal or replacement

**Ask plainly:** *"How quickly can a caregiver be removed if there’s a concern?"* The answer should be immediate and procedural.

## 5. Insurance, Bonding & Liability Protection

Liability must rest with the agency, not the client or estate. Confirm the provider carries:

*   General liability insurance
*   Workers’ compensation coverage
*   Bonding or equivalent financial safeguards
*   Proof of coverage available upon request

If a caregiver is injured or causes damage, the agency — not the conservatorship or trust — should bear the risk.

## 6. Financial Transparency & Estate Preservation

Fiduciaries are obligated to protect assets, not just approve services. Review:

*   How hours are tracked and billed
*   Rate changes based on care complexity
*   Handling of missed shifts or substitutions
*   Coordination with VA or other benefits if applicable

Unclear billing is one of the most common sources of family conflict and court involvement.

## 7. Communication, Reporting & Incident Notification

Problems should never come as a surprise. Strong providers offer:

*   Daily or shift-based care logs
*   Prompt reporting of incidents or condition changes
*   Clear points of contact for guardians, conservators, or attorneys
*   Willing coordination with courts, care managers, and medical professionals

Resistance to transparency is a serious red flag.

## 8. Backup Coverage & Continuity of Care

Missed shifts can create immediate safety risks. Ask how the agency ensures:

*   Backup caregivers for illness or no-shows
*   Emergency coverage
*   Continuity for cognitively impaired or high-risk clients

"Best effort" is not a plan. Written backup protocols matter.

## Key Takeaways for Colorado Fiduciaries

Whether you are an attorney, guardian, conservator, or POA, approving a home care provider in Colorado requires more than trust — it requires verification.

**Before authorizing care:**
*   ✅ Confirm CDPHE licensing and classification
*   ✅ Require written disclosures and contracts
*   ✅ Validate care planning and documentation
*   ✅ Confirm caregiver screening and training
*   ✅ Ensure liability rests with the agency
*   ✅ Demand transparent billing and reporting

The right provider reduces risk, protects dignity, and stands up to scrutiny. The wrong one creates exposure — legal, financial, and personal.
